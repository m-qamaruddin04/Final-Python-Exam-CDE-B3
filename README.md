# Final-Python-Exam-CDE-B3
Final Python Exam CDE-B3 , Scenarios (1-4)

🧩 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of four fundamental Python programming concepts through practical scenarios:

1- File Processing and Exception Handling
2- Object-Oriented Programming and Inheritance
3- Functions and Modules
4- Debugging and Code Correction

Each scenario includes Python code, explanations, and test examples to show correct functionality and expected results.

⚙️ Scenario 1 – File Processing and Exception Handling

Objective

Create a program to manage student records from a text file, calculate the average grade, and handle exceptions gracefully.

Key Features

Reads student names and grades from a text file.
Handles file not found errors by automatically creating the file.
Uses a custom exception for invalid grades.
Calculates and displays the average grade of valid entries.

Concepts Used

File handling (open, with)
Custom exception class
Try–except blocks
Input validation and error messages

Expected Output
⚠️ Invalid grade 'Invalid Grade' for student: Grace
✅ Average Grade of 6 students: 84.17

🧱 Scenario 2 – Object-Oriented Programming and Inheritance
Objective

Design a vehicle management system demonstrating class inheritance and polymorphism.

Key Features

Base class: Vehicle with attributes make, model, and year.

Subclasses:

Car (number of doors)

Truck (cargo capacity)

Motorcycle (drive type)

Each subclass overrides and extends base methods.

Demonstrates method overriding, inheritance, and object interaction.

Concepts Used

OOP Principles: Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism

Method overriding (display_info())

Class constructors (__init__)

Expected Output
--- Car Details ---
🚗 Vehicle Info: 2022 Toyota Corolla
 - Number of doors: 4
Toyota Corolla's engine started.
Toyota Corolla is accelerating smoothly!
Toyota Corolla's engine stopped.

📚 Scenario 3 – Functions and Modules (Library Management System)
Objective

Develop a small library management system using functions, modules, and built-in features.

Key Features

Manage book inventory (add, remove, display).

Borrow and return books with fine calculation.

Fine calculated using math module.

Use of lambda functions to filter overdue books.

List comprehensions for borrowed book reports.

Concepts Used

Functions and modular programming

math module

Lambda expressions

List comprehensions

Data structures (list, dict)

Expected Output
💰 'Python Programming' returned 9 days late. Fine: Rs 6.0

📅 Overdue Books (using lambda):
 - Machine Learning: 12 days overdue

📋 Borrowed Books Report (using list comprehension):
 - Data Structures (5 days borrowed)
 - Machine Learning (12 days borrowed)
 - Python Programming (2 days borrowed)

🐞 Scenario 4 – Debugging and Code Correction
Objective

Fix syntax and logic errors in a faulty Python script performing mathematical operations.

Key Features

Corrected missing colons and indentation errors.

Fixed total and product calculations.

Added function testing and print output.

Concepts Used

Debugging syntax and logical errors

Function definition and looping

Arithmetic operations and return values

Expected Output
Total: 15
Product: 120
Average: 3.0

🧠 Key Learnings
Concept	Scenario Demonstrated
File Handling & Exceptions	(Scenario 1)
Object-Oriented Programming	(Scenario 2)
Functions, Modules, & Math	(Scenario 3)
Debugging & Error Fixing	  (Scenario 4)

🚀 How to Run

Install Python (version 3.8 or above).
Save each scenario’s code in separate .py files (or run directly in an IDE).

Run using:

python scenario1.py
python scenario2.py
python scenario3.py
python scenario4.py

Check the console output to verify expected results.
